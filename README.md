Indian Institure of Management Amritsar in collaboration with Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland organized the 3rd International Conference on Management of MSMEs (ICMM 2024) on the theme: "Transformative Pathways for MSMEs: Shaping the Future". 

I authored and presented a research paper titled "An Approach to Automate Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing for Start-ups".


Abstract:
Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) describes a broad range of security
assessment services designed to identify and address cyber security exposures across an
organisation’s IT estate. Cyber-attacks and threats are real-world problems today with thousands
of networks and websites and being compromised every day. Some of the normal reasons we see
for carrying out a VAPT are: a) Customer needs, specifically for security of their information, b)
Compliance of Industry standards, c) Validation of security controls, d) Proactive security audits
to protect their data and systems from new threats.
Even for start-ups, to understand and tackle each vulnerability manually, is not easy. It
involves lot of manual efforts and time. Also, since each start-up might have different
requirements, (i.e features from various stake-holders on its application), therefore, customizing
the VAPT process exclusively for a start-up makes the task of the process developer complex and
at times difficult to achieve in real time. An attempt is made to automate the VAPT process for
start-ups. The process consists of identification of vulnerability and penetration, and automate the
process using various tools or by bash scripting. In this work, we present the automated VAPT
process, developed specifically for the start-ups.
